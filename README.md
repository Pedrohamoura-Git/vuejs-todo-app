What I learned
This challenge was a great opportunity to test my CSS, JS and Vue.JS skills. I need to do some research to learn a little more about how Vue handles transitions, how to work correctly with 'created' and 'watch' methods, theme switcher, arrow functions, and how to set elements in local storage.

Continued development
To my next project I want to test my JS skills by using an API.
